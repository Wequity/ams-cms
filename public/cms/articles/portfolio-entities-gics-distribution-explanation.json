This chart is a graphical representation of that distribution. We do not weigh these using AuM shares yet, but this can be done in a following iteration.\n\nThe X-axis gives raw numbers of companies per sector. \\\n\\\n***Calculation Methodology:*** \\\n*Let's say you have 2 portfolio companies, which operate in 3 GICS sectors (e.g. one operates in energy, and the other company operates in materials & manufacturing). We count that the companies both represent 50% - 50%. In this case, we would estimate that 50% your portfolio activities relate to Energy, 25% to Materials, & 25% to Manufacturing; where the total makes 100%.*"
